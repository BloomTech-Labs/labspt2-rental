### Motivation

Roostr is a SaaS application that gives short-term rental property managers the ability to manage properties more easily. Our software makes it easy for a manager to view properties and their availabilities, bookings, maintenance issues, and keep track of all to do items before, during and after a guestâ€™s stay

With a simplistic UI design, Rental POS combines the standard SaaS software that exists currently for managing reservations with the ability to easily coordinate employees who work on property, in one place, without having to utilize an extremely robust software. Rental POS is more extensive than most existing vacation rental solutions but lower cost than enterprise level solutions. Our software is ideal for rental property managers of 1-50 properties.
